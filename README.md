# SiteSearch-Desktop
A native desktop software to search through a specific website which is not indexed by popular search engines.  
The basic idea is to get a URL and a keyword from a user and search through the site to find that keyword.
If found, output the URL in which it was found.

Want to try the command line alpha of SiteSearch-Desktop?
Download this [SiteSearch-Desktop](https://github.com/SohanChy/SiteSearch-Desktop/blob/master/bin/Release/SiteSearch-Desktop.zip?raw=true) zip file,  extract it to any folder.
Enter that folder and right click **SiteSearch-Desktop.exe** and click on **Run as Administrator** and then follow the onscreen instructions.

I don't yet know *why* exactly it needs Administrator rights to work properly, But I'm guessing it has something to do with https and Curl.
